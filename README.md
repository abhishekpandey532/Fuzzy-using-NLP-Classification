Fuzzy Classification based model using NLP

Web document classification is the primary requirement for search engines, which retrieve documents in response to the user query. Documents classification can be applied as an information filtering tool and can also be used to improve the retrieval results from a query process. Classification is one of the main data analysis techniques and deals with the categorizing a new data entry into one of the categories based on the values of different attributes. In general, classification algorithm needs to train a model based on pre-classified training documents.

Once the model is ready, we can subject the test documents for evaluation through that model and that brings the classification process to an end. we proposed an approach for automatically classifying web documents into a set of categories using Fuzzy Feature Category Similarity Analyzer (FFCSA)  and vector space model (VSM). In our approach, we have given a set of example documents. We pre-process the documents by parsing and removing the stop words, doing stemming  and extracted noun as keywords. The new documents are classified by applying vector space model technique on these derived feature sets.
